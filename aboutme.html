            Even though it was tough, these moments made me curious. They taught me to keep trying, even when things were hard. Now, as I easily use the internet, I remember those tough times. They showed me how to be determined and clever, helping me
            find connection even when it seemed impossible.

            Being part of MARC provided me with invaluable hands-on experience, allowing me to expand my knowledge and skills in this fascinating field. Through MARC, I forged lasting connections with fellow enthusiasts and contributed to our shared passion

These groups had become not just commitments but extensions of my identity and purpose. As I made the difficult decision to step back, I couldn't
                help but feel a sense of loss. In those moments of sorrow, the lyrics of "Bayan Ko " resonated deeply within me. The song's poignant words spoke to my inner turmoil, capturing the pain of sacrificing something cherished for the greater
                good of my country and fellowmen. </p>
